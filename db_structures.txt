(these are mostly just ideas at this point, subject to change at any time and field sizes may be incorrect and/or unoptimized (I'm not the best at creating databases lel))

Users:
	id = int
	username = string(64)
	password = string(64?)
	email = string(64?) // is this needed? probably not
	lastloginip = string(32) // last IP logged in from, as string
	remembercookie = string(16) // string to remember the user
	role = int // 0=user, 1=banned, 2=mod

Records:
	id = int
	user = int
	map = string(32) // hash of the map
	character = string(16)
	playerbest = int // flags: 1=best score, 2=best time, 4=best rings (non-NiGHTS)
	score = int
	time = int
	rings = int
	submitted = timestamp (as int)

Maps:
	id = int
	hash = string(32) // map hash
	name = string(40)
	description = string(4096) // can contain HTML, should be fine since only mods can set this anyway
	type = int // 0=record attack, 1=NiGHTS
	levelpic = string(32) // filename of level select pic (in /levelpics)
	banned = boolean // if true then replays for this map will be rejected

Characters:
	id = int
	skin = string(16)
	name = string(32) // actual printed name, whereas above is used as the code-based identifier
	icon = string(32) // filename of character icon (in /charpics)
	description = string(4096) // can contain HTML, should be fine since only mods can set this anyway
	banned = boolean // if true then replays for this character will be rejected
